		<h2>Message From BOG</h2>
		
		<p>On behalf of the BOG, staff, students and the entire family of BukedeaLifeLine Secondary School, I hereby take this privilege to thank the Lord for the forteen years He has taken us through. I do extend congratulations to all those that have been involved in this journey that our School has been traveling.</p>
		<p>Education is the best gift you can give anyone. Finding a school that offers holistic training is not easy to come by. BukedeaLifeLine Secondary school was started to help the community as that is the smallest gift we can give. For sustainability, we must collect school fees. But if you visit here and see the smiles of the over 1,200 students we have, you feel good. As a father, I feel proud with the kind of interventions we are making.</p>
		<p>Our school offers holistic education. We make sure that we provide education to nurture the heart, the brain and the hands. We believe that since the students spend most of their time at school, we have to act as their parents. Each teacher is attached to a maximum of twenty five children, they have to know how they are doing academically, emotionally, follow up on their requirement because these are critical areas for a child to succeed. Any normal person with these areas may succeed academically but also you may have others who are challenged emotionally who need to be helped.</p>
		<p>We have the spiritual aspect which is well known. We are born again Christians and have put up in place structures that empower our children to have their spiritual life nurtured, we try to interact externally in that you canâ€™t work as one, you can run as one to a certain distance but if you are together you run further. We have associations we interact with where we believe their experience in technology and sciences is advanced. we are trying to build a team of both teachers and students who are exposed. We go ahead to train our teachers because at the end of the day they are the ones who instill knowledge and skills to our children.</p>
